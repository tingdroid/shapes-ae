<h1>The GeomLab language</h1>

<p>This page contains a concise and fairly formal description of the
programming language that is part of GeomLab. Reading it is almost
certainly not the best way to learn to write programs for GeomLab:
instead, it is better to follow the examples that are contained in the
worksheets.</p>

<p>The GeomLab language is a general-purpose programming language in
the sense that it is not tailored towards the graphics programming
that is the theme of the worksheets, and it is capable of describing
any function that can be computed. Its chief feature is that it is
purely applicative: there are no "variables" in the language that can
be assigned different values at different times in the execution of a
program, but like the variables of ordinary mathematics, each variable
has a single value. As in mathematics, the same equation or definition
can be used several times in a calculation, with the variables
standing for different values each time it is used.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp; Syntax</h2>

<p>An expression or definition consists of a sequence of tokens made
up of ASCII characters. Each token belongs to one of these classes:
names, numbers, strings, operators and delimiters. Blanks and
line breaks may not occur within tokens, except in comments and for
blanks in strings, but are otherwise ignored unless they separate two
consecutive tokens that might otherwise be read as one. Upper and
lower case letters are treated as distinct.</p>

<p>An <i>identifier</i> is any sequence of letters, digits and
underscores that begins with a letter or underscore, except for the
reserved words that are listed below.</p>

<p>A <i>number token</i> is any sequence of decimal digits, followed
optionally by a decimal point and a further (possibly empty) sequence
of decimal digits, then optionally by the letter <code>E</code>, an
optional plus or minus sign, and a sequence of digits.</p>

<p>A <i>string</i> is a sequence of characters enclosed between two
double-quote characters. A string may not contain a double-quote
character or a line break.</p>

<p>An <i>operator</i> or <i>delimiter</i> is one of the reserved words
and special symbols in the list that follows. Reserved words appear
entirely in lower case, and may not be used as names.</p>

<pre>and define div else if in lambda let mod not op or then when
_ = + - $ * / &amp; ~ : @ &lt; &lt;= &lt;&gt; &gt; &gt;= ( ) [ ] , ; |</pre>

<p>In most places where an identifier may appear in a GeomLab program,
the keyword <code>op</code> may also appear, followed by an operator
symbol; this acts as the name of the operator.</p>

<pre>Name = Ident | "op" Operator</pre>

<p>The syntax of expressions and definitions in the GeomLab
language is given
in subsequent sections of this document using EBNF notation. In this
notation,
square brackets <code>[ ... ]</code> enclose optional text, and curly
brackets <code>{ ... }</code> enclose text that may be repeated zero
or more times.
</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp; Values</h2>

<p>The following kinds of value are denoted by expressions in the
GeomLab language:</p>

<h3>2.1.&nbsp; Numbers</h3>

<p>Numbers in the GeomLab language are represented in
double-precision floating point format, even if they are integers.
Numbers are denoted by
number tokens, and are yielded as the results of arithmetic operations.</p>

<h3>2.2.&nbsp; Booleans</h3>

<p>The Boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
are denoted by pre-defined names, and are yielded as the results of
comparison operators.</p>

<h3>2.3.&nbsp; Strings</h3>

<p>Strings are denoted by string tokens. <i>Strings are
not much used in
GeomLab programming, and are included mostly for internal use "under
the bonnet" in implementing the other language features.</i>
</p>

<h3>2.4.&nbsp; Lists</h3>

<p>The empty list is denoted by the expression <code>[&nbsp;]</code>,
and non-empty lists may be constructed with the operator
"<code>:</code>". A list expression <code>[<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, ..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>]</code>
is an abbreviation for a list of length <i>n</i> constructed in
this way.
Because the GeomLab language is untyped, there is no guarantee that
arbitrary lists are <i>proper</i>, in the sense that they
end properly
with the value <code>[&nbsp;]</code>.</p>

<h3>2.5.&nbsp; Functions</h3>

<p>Names in GeomLab programs may denote functions, either
primitive functions that are part of the initial environment or
installed as a plug-in extension, or functions that are defined as
part of the GeomLab program. Each function takes a fixed number of
values as its 
arguments and deliviers a single value as its result. Functions are
created by function definitions (see Section 6.2) and by <code>lambda</code>
expressions (see Section 8.2).</p>

<h3>2.6.&nbsp; Other values</h3>

<p>Other kinds of value may be added to the GeomLab languages as
plug-in
extensions.
Typically, such extensions come with a collection of primitive
functions
for creating and manipulating the new values.
In the GeomLab environment, colours and pictures are provided as
additional kinds of value in this way.</p>

<h2>3. Scope rules</h2>

<p>Expressions are evaluated in the context of an environment that
gives values to the variables that appear in the expression. An
environment has two parts: the global part contains the pre-defined
names that are built in to the GeomLab system, together with
additional names that have been added by top-level definitions. There
is also a local part of the environment that contains names that have
been defined by pattern-matching in a function definition, or by one
of the additional forms of expression covered in
Section&nbsp;8. Unless these additional forms of expression are used, 
there is no nesting of environments in GeomLab, and the scope rules
can be summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The local part of the environment takes precedence over the
  global part.  Thus, if the same name is used for a global variable and
  for one of the formal parameters of a function, then it is the formal
  parameter that is denoted by the name within the function body.</li>

  <li>If a function is defined, and then later applied after further
  definitions have been added to the global environment, then it is the
  global environment at the time the function is applied that is used
  for evaluating the function body -- a form of dynamic binding. This
  rule is a natural one for interactive programming, and allows
  naturally for mutual recursion among top-level functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The additional forms of expression introduced in Section&nbsp;8
allow the possiblility of nested scopes in which function values are
first-class citizens. For these forms of expression, it is necessary
to add the rule that the local part of the environment is treated
according to static binding.  Thus, function values capture the local
part of the environment at the point of definition, and it is this
local part, and not the one in force at the point of application, that
is used to evaluate the function body.  Recursion is allowed in local
function definitions but not in local value definitions.</p>

<h2>4. Expressions</h2>

<pre>Primary    = Name | Number | String
           | Name { "(" [ Expression { "," Expression } ] ")" }
           | "(" Expression ")" 
           | "[" [ Expression { "," Expression } ] "]"
 
Factor     = ( "-" | "~" ) Factor | Primary 
 
Term0      = { Factor ":" } Factor
Term1      = Term0 { ( "*" | "/" | "$" ) Term0
Term2      = Term1 { ( "+" | "-" | "&amp;" ) Term1 }
Term3      = { Term2 "@" } Term2
Term4      = Term3 { ( "=" | "&lt;" | "&lt;=" | "&lt;&gt;" | "&gt;" | "&gt;=" ) Term3 }
Term5      = Term4 { and Term4 }
Term       = Term5 { or Term5 }

BasicExpr  = Term | if Term then BasicExpr else BasicExpr

Expression = BasicExpr | LetExpr | LambdaExpr</pre>

<h3>4.1.&nbsp; Primary expressions</h3>

<p>The smallest expressions are names, which denote the value to which
they are bound in the environment; number tokens, which denote a
numeric constant; and string tokens, which denote a constant string.
Any expression may appear in parentheses as an operand in a larger
expression.</p>

<p>An expression 
<code>[<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>, 
..., <i>e<sub>n</sub></i>]</code> 
denotes a list made up of
the <code>n</code> values that are denoted by the expressions 
<code>e1</code>, <code>e2</code>,
...&nbsp;<code>en</code>.</p>  This list is constructed using the empty list
(denoted <code>[ ]</code>) by <code>n</code> applications of the construction
operator&nbsp;"<code>:</code>".

<h3>4.3.&nbsp; Function application</h3>

<p>An expression <code><i>f</i>(<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>e</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>e<sub>n</sub></i>)</code>
denotes the application of a
function <code><i>f</i></code> to the <code><i>n</i></code>
arguments <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub></code>,
..., <code><i>e<sub>n</sub></i></code>.
The number of arguments must match the number expected
by <code><i>f</i></code>. The arguments and
the function <i><u>f</u></i> are first
evaluated.
If <code><i>f</i></code> is a function that
has been defined
as part of the GeomLab program, then the argument values are matched
with
the patterns that appear in the definition of <code><i>f</i></code>,
and the value
of the application is that value of the appropriate function body.
Other functions are implemented as primitives in the initial
environment of the GeomLab program, and deliver a result that
cannot be expressed as the value of another expression.</p>

<h3>4.4.&nbsp; Unary and binary operators</h3>

<p>Simple expressions may be combined with various unary and binary
operators to form more complex expressions; these operators have the
binding powers that are implied by the syntax rules above. All binary
operators associate to the left, except for "<code>:</code>" and
<code>@</code>, which associate to the right.  An expression written
with a prefix or infix operator is just an abbreviation for the
application of the same operator as a function. Thus, the expression
<code><i>x&nbsp;</i>+&nbsp;<i>y</i></code> is an abbreviation for the
binary function application <code>(op +)(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</code>;
this expression uses the name <code>op +</code> that is bound to the
addition primitive.  All the operators of
GeomLab are bound to different primitive functions in the initial
environment.</p>

<p>An exception to this rule is made in the case of the operators
<code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, which are evaluated in a
'short-circuit' fashion: thus, in the expression <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub>
and <i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code>, the
sub-expression <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub></code>
must yield a Boolean value. If this value is <code>true</code>,
then the
value of the expression is whatever value is yielded by evaluating
<code><i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code>; otherwise the value of the 
expression is <code>false</code>.
Similarly, the value of <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub>
or <i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code> is the
value of <code><i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code>
if <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub></code>
yields <code>false</code>, and otherwise it is <code>true</code>.
This means that <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub>
and <i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code> is
equivalent to the
conditional expression</p>

<blockquote><code>if <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> then <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
else false</code></blockquote>

<p>
and <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub> or <i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code>
is equivalent to</p>

<blockquote><code>if <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> then true else
<i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code></blockquote>

<h3>4.5.&nbsp; Conditional expressions</h3>

<p>
An expression <code>if <i>e</i><sub>1</sub>
then <i>e</i><sub>2</sub> else <i>e</i><sub>3</sub></code>
is
evaluated by first finding the value of <code><i>e</i><sub>1</sub></code>.
This should
be a Boolean value, either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>;
an
error is reported if it is not. Then either <code><i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code>
or <code><i>e</i><sub>3</sub></code>
is chosen for evaluation, depending on the Boolean value, and the value
of the chosen expression becomes the value of the whole
conditional expression. The other sub-expression is not evaluated.</p>

<h3>4.6.&nbsp; Other forms of expression</h3>

<p>
Two additional forms of expression -- <u>let</u>
expressions and <u> lambda</u> expressions -- are allowed.
They are described on Section&nbsp;8.</p>

<h2>5. Patterns</h2>

<p>Patterns are used in function definitions (see Section&nbsp;6) and
<code>lambda</code> 
expressions (see Section&nbsp;8) to match the arguments
of a function. An attempt to match a pattern against a value may either
succeed or fail; if it succeeds, then the names that appear in the
expression
become bound to parts of the original value. A name may appear more
than once
in a pattern or list of patterns; in that case, matching fails unless
the values that it matches are all equal. The equality test that is
applied is the same as the one used
for the <code>=</code> operator.</p>

<pre>PattPrimary = Name | "_" 
            | [ "-" | "~" ] Number 
            | String
            | "(" Pattern ")" 
            | "[" [ Pattern { "," Pattern } ] "]"

PattFactor  = PattPrimary { ":" PattPrimary }

Pattern     = PattFactor { "+" Number }</pre>

<h3>5.1.&nbsp; Primary patterns</h3>

<p>The simplest patterns are names, which match any value and bind the
name to it; the anonymous pattern <code>_</code> which matches any
value but does not bind a name; positive and negative numbers and
strings, which match the single, constant values denoted by the number
or string.  Any pattern may also be enclosed in parentheses and used
as a primary part of a larger pattern.</p>

<p>A list pattern
<code>[<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, 
..., <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>]</code> 
matches any list of length <code>n</code> whose elements are matched by the
patterns <code><i>p</i><sub>1</sub></code>, 
<code><i>p</i><sub>2</sub></code>, 
...&nbsp;<code><i>p<sub>n</sub></i></code> respectively.</p>

<h3>5.2.&nbsp; Cons patterns</h3>

<p>A "cons" pattern
<code><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>:<i>p</i><sub>2</sub></code> matches any
non-empty list whose head is 
matched by <code><i>p</i><sub>1</sub></code> and whose tail is matched
by <code><i>p</i><sub>2</sub></code>.</p>

<h3>5.3.&nbsp; Plus patterns</h3>

<p>A "plus" pattern has the form <code><i>p</i>+<i>n</i></code>,
where <code><i>n</i></code> is a number. It matches a number
<code><i>x</i></code> if <code><i>n</i> &gt; 0</code>
and the difference <code><i>y</i> = <i> x</i> - <i> n</i></code> 
is an integer such that <code><i>y</i> &gt;= 0</code> 
and the pattern <code><i>p</i></code> 
matches&nbsp;<code><i>y</i></code>.</p>

<h2>6. Definitions</h2>

<pre>Definition = ValueDef | FuncDef</pre>

<p>Definitions appear in <code>define</code> paragraphs to
add a definition to the
global environment, and also in <code>let</code>
expressions to define a name locally to an expression.</p>

<h3>6.1.&nbsp; Value definitions</h3>

<pre>ValueDef = Name "=" Expression</pre>

<p>A value definition defines a name as standing for the value of a
certain expression. The expression is evaluated immediately, and the
name becomes bound to its value.</p>

<h3>6.2.&nbsp; Function definitions</h3>

<pre>FuncDef = Clause { "|" Clause }

Clause  = Name Formals "=" Expression [ when Expression ]

Formals = "(" [ Pattern { "," Pattern } ] ")"</pre>

<p>A function definition defines a name as standing for a function.
The function is defined by a sequence of clauses, each containing a
list of patterns that are matched against the arguments of the
function, and expression that gives the corresponding value yielded by
the function, and optionally a boolean-valued <i>guard</i> expression
after <code>when</code> that
specifies a condition under which the clause applies.
For a function definition to be syntactically valid, all the
clauses must contain the same function name, and all must contain the
same number of argument patterns, the number of arguments that is
expected by the function.</p>

<p>When the function is applied to arguments, the clauses in the
definition are considered in order, and the first applicable one
determines the value that is yielded by the application.  To apply a
clause, the patterns in the clause are first matched with the incoming
arguments.  If they all match, then the guard (if any) is evaluated;
if the value of the guard is <code>false</code>, then the clause does
not apply.  Finally, the right-hand side expression is evaluated, and
its value becomes the value yielded by the function application.
If any guard that is evaluated fails to return a Boolean result, or
if no clause is applicable to the arguments, then the evaluation
fails.</p>

<p>The definition of a function may have several clauses, each
one matching a different pattern of arguments. For example,
here is the definition of a function <code>pow(a, b)</code> that
computes <code>a</code> raised to the power <code>b</code>:</p>

<pre>define pow(a, b) = a * pow(a, b-1) when b &gt; 0
 | pow(a, 0) = 1</pre>

<p>The first clause deals with the case where <code>b &gt; 0</code>, defining
<code>pow(a, b)</code> in terms of <code>pow(a, b-1)</code>; the
second clause deals with 
the case where <code>b = 0</code>, giving the result directly,
and providing a place for the recursion to stop. (The function is not
defined at all if <code>b &lt; 0</code>.)</p>

<p>The first clause in this definition has patterns (<code>a</code>
and <code>b</code>) that will match any arguments that are
supplied, but the guard <code>b &gt; 0</code> rules out those where
<code>b &lt;= 0</code>. The second clause matches those argument lists
where the second argument is equal to 0.</p>

<h2>7. Paragraphs</h2>

<pre>Paragraph = Expression [ ";" ] 
          | define Definition [ ";" ]</pre>

<p>A program in the GeomLab language consists of a sequence of
<i>paragraphs</i> that are entered at the top-level prompt or read
from one or more text files.
Each paragraph is either an expression to be evaluated in the current
global environment, or a definition that adds to that environment.</p>

<p>When paragraphs are written on a file for use with the
File/Load command of GeomLab, each paragraph must end with a semicolon.
The semicolon can be
omitted when paragraphs are entered at the interactive prompt.</p>

<h2>8. Additional forms of expression</h2>

<p>There are two additional forms of expression -- <code>let</code>
expressions and <code>lambda</code> expressions --
that are not needed for the
worksheets, but are useful in more advanced programming. These
forms of expression do not add to the expressive power of the language,
but they do make some kinds of program easier to write.</p>

<h3>8.1.&nbsp; <code>let</code> expressions</h3>

<pre>LetExpr = let Definition in Expression</pre>

<p>An expression <code>let <i>d</i> in <i>e</i></code>
allows the name defined
by the definition <code><i>d</i></code> to be
used in the expression <code><i>e</i></code>.
For example, the value of the expression</p>

<pre>let y = x + 1 in y * y</pre>

<p>is the square of whatever is the value of <code>x + 1</code>.
The advantages
of using a <code>let</code> expression is that it is often
clearer to do so, and
sometimes shorter and more efficient than writing out the expression
and substituting the right-hand side of the definition for the
left-hand side,
like this:</p>

<pre>(x + 1) * (x + 1)</pre>

<p>Also, <code>let</code> expressions can be used to define
functions that are local to a single expression.</p>

<h3>8.2.&nbsp; <code>lambda</code> expressions</h3>

<pre>LambdaExpr = lambda Formals Expression</pre>

<p>A <code>lambda</code> expression denotes a function that is defined
by a single clause with no guard.  A <code>lambda</code>
expression</p>

<blockquote><code>lambda (<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>) e</code></blockquote>

<p>denotes the same function <code>f</code> as is defined by the
definition</p>

<blockquote><code>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>) = e</code></blockquote>

<p>There is no need, however, to invent a fresh name <code>f</code> in
order to write the function as a <code>lambda</code> expression.
<code>Lambda</code> expressions are mainly used in more advanced
programming to specify arguments to higher-order functions.</p>
